  "description": "Have the carrier's heading displayed when a Landing Request is made. This uses the Tutorial Display to output the the heading of the carrier you requested to land at. I used [MAGIC CARPET](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/r6e24mwf/) by Afroman and [Subtitles Mod](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/7sszewba/) by THE_GREAT_OVERLORD_OF_ALL_CHEESE as general guides to get this small mod going.\r\n\r\nImage is from https://vtol-vr.fandom.com/wiki/Aircraft_Carrier edited by me. I think it's covered by the CC-BY-SA license, but I'm willing to get sued to find out I guess.\r\n\r\nThis was very much a small mod to test to see how making a mod works in VTOL VR, all I learned is that PostFix is different from Postfix to Harmony.",
